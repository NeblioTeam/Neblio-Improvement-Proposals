# Neblio Improvement Proposals

This repository contains all submitted Neblio Improvement Proposals (NIPs) for the Neblio Blockchain Network. 

NIPs are driven by the Neblio community, node operators, developers, and partners to shape the Neblio Blockchain Network Roadmap.

Approved proposals can be voted on by operators of the Neblio Network via staking using Neblio Core v3.4.0 or higher. 

Neblio Network Operators (stakers) vote on proposals. **Proposals must have at least 20% vote participation AND receive at least 50% `YEA` votes to be successful.**

To learn more about proposals and how to vote, see here (LINK NEEDED). 

## How to Submit a Proposal

1. Proposals must be submitted via an [Issue (Click Here to Get Started)](https://github.com/NeblioTeam/Neblio-Improvement-Proposals/issues/new?assignees=NeblioTeam&labels=&template=NIP-SUBMISSION.yml&title=%5BNew+NIP%5D%3A+NIP+Name+Here) to this repository using the provided Issue Template. Approved Issues will be added into the `proposals.json` file. 
2. Proposals will be discussed in the comments of the Issue before approval for voting. 
3. Proposals will be approved for voting by default, unless they are incorrectly formatted, outlandish, or impossible. 
4. Proposals are not only for Neblio Core, but for all aspects of the Neblio Network, including (but not limited to) other Neblio software and services, promotions, campaigns, etc.
5. Proposals, once approved, will have a block range assigned for voting and will be visible on the [Neblio Block Explorer](https://explorer.nebl.io/proposals).
6. Proposals should be promoted by the submitter. You are responsible for explaining your proposal and encouraging stakers to vote for it. 
7. Proposals that fail their vote can be edited and resubmitted as a new proposal (The exact same proposal should NOT be submitted twice).
8. Proposals will shape the Neblio Network roadmap, however the Neblio Core Team will not implement all proposals that have a successful vote. Successful proposals that are outside of our Team's areas of expertise, or are too costly for us to implement, will be given `UP FOR GRABS` and/or `FUNDING NEEDED` tags on the roadmap. These proposals will need to be implemented by developers outside of the Neblio Core Team and may include bounty programs to encourage that development.
