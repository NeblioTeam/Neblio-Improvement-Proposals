## Neblio Improvement Proposal Submission Template

### Proposal Name
Name Here

### Proposal Description
Description Here, the more information about your proposal, the better. Include every relevant detail about your proposal.

### Proposal Voting Details
If you would like to have your proposal voted on during a certain block range, or for a certain duration of time, please include that request here. The Neblio Network creates roughly 120 blocks per hour, or 2,880 blocks per day. We recommend votes last at least 5 days, or 14,400 blocks. The exact block range will be scheduled after your proposal is approved, based on other approved proposals in the pipeline that are already scheduled (we try not to overlap voting ranges, if possible). **Remember, proposals MUST have at least 20% vote participation AND receive at least 50% `YEA` votes to be successful.**

### Other Information
If you would like to include any other information with your submission, please include it here.
